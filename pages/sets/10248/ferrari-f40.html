  <h2>The Ferrari F40</h2>
  <p>
    The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina.
    It was built from 1987 until 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively.
    It was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari.
    At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.

  <h2>The Turbo</h2>

  <p>
    The 911 Turbo was first introduced at the German "IAA" Motor Show in Frankfurt in 1973 with the series production version launching a year later 
    at the 1974 Paris Motor Show. Known internally as Type 930, the sports car featured many technical details taken directly from motorsport and was 
    therefore one of the fastest cars of its time.

  <h2>The Targa</h2>

  <p>
    Responding to increased safety requirements for open top cars in the US, Porsche designed the world’s first safety cabriolet with a fixed roll-over bar. 
    The first 911 Targa was introduced in 1965. The name itself came from the Targa Florio road race in Sicily where Porsche had enjoyed great motorsport 
    success since the mid 1950s.

  <h2>From the Design Team</h2>
  <p>
    This model started out as a passion project of mine. Naturally, I’m very excited that we decided to make it into an actual LEGO® set. I began by reading 
    all about the different Porsche 911 versions and gathered lots of images of the car to work from. The major challenge was designing the model so it could 
    be built as either a Turbo or a Targa. We built five different versions of the car before we were happy with the result. I’m especially proud of how well 
    we managed to capture the “face” of this car; the front bumper and the angled headlights, etc. It’s classic 911!
