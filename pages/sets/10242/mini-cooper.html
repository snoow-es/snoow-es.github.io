  <h2>The Mini Cooper</h2>
  <p>
    When the Porsche 911 was first introduced at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show, it was quickly recognised as a triumph of both design and engineering. 
    Six decades and eight generations later, the concept still endures and the 911 remains one of the most iconic sports cars of all time.

    The 911 Turbo was first introduced at the German "IAA" Motor Show in Frankfurt in 1973 with the series production version launching a year later 
    at the 1974 Paris Motor Show. Known internally as Type 930, the sports car featured many technical details taken directly from motorsport and was 
    therefore one of the fastest cars of its time.

    Responding to increased safety requirements for open top cars in the US, Porsche designed the world’s first safety cabriolet with a fixed roll-over bar. 
    The first 911 Targa was introduced in 1965. The name itself came from the Targa Florio road race in Sicily where Porsche had enjoyed great motorsport 
    success since the mid 1950s.

    This model started out as a passion project of mine. Naturally, I’m very excited that we decided to make it into an actual LEGO® set. I began by reading 
    all about the different Porsche 911 versions and gathered lots of images of the car to work from. The major challenge was designing the model so it could 
    be built as either a Turbo or a Targa. We built five different versions of the car before we were happy with the result. I’m especially proud of how well 
    we managed to capture the “face” of this car; the front bumper and the angled headlights, etc. It’s classic 911!
